# Pokemon Rescue

Welcome to Pokemon Rescue where you are in charge of helping poor Pokemon creatures find homes.

## How to play

You are the head of a small Pokemon rescue (think humane center) where you will find Pokemon wandering in the wilderness.  Your job is to find these poor creatures, feed them and allow them to play.  Once they are healthy and happy they could be adopted by people.

### Pokemon

You will find Pokemon in the wilderness to the right (east) of your farm. Wander around and see if you can find any, when you do use the "A" button to pick them up. You can then carry them into the farm to eat some food or into the outdoor playpen where they can play. 

### The playpen

The playpen outside the barn is the only place where the Pokemon feel comfortable enough to play.  Make sure you have at least 2 in the playpen so they can play with each-other!

### The Barn

In the barn you will find pens where you can place the Pokemon to eat. The Pokemon don't like to share food, so be sure to keep them separate.

### Phone

The phone may ring if you have any Pokemon that are happy and healthy enough to be adopted!  Feel free to answer it in time and let the person know what Pokemon are available for adoption.

### Computer

The computer lets you save your game, make sure to do it whenever you get a chance (be aware, hardware devices may have a shorter lifespan if you save frequently).
